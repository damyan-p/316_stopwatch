Display only outputs 000 instead of 00.00 
flipping sw1 immediately sets to 999 reset doesnt set the thign.

start button ( t18 or top most does nothing ) 
reset does notghint ( middle or u18) 

It's just broken.

i changed soemthign in the clock divider folder. 

It's probably still a lcok issue. 

with the select both low 00 

it displays 0. 0 0. 0. and it flickers. it hasa  . the opposite of where it should.  

pressing start you see strange numbers on the display. reset sort of sets it back to 0. 0 0. 0. 

there is incredilby weird behiavior for perssing start.
